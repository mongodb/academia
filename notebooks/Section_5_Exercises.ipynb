    "- **Code cells:** Cells shaded grey are code cells. As you work through the lab, run all code cells in order.\n",
    "- **Running code:** To run code, press Shift + Enter or click the 'Run' button on the menu bar. Where there is code already in a cell, run it as written. Where a code cell contains the comment `#Write your code here`, write code to complete the task & then run it. If needed, consult the hints & answer to enter and run the correct entry for a task before moving on to the next task. Not every command will result in visible output.\n",
    "- **Markdown cells:** The non-code cells are written in the Markdown markup language. Double-clicking a Markdown cell will cause it to appear in raw Markdown format. To render as text again, run the cell just like running a code cell: press Shift + Enter or click the 'Run' button on the menu bar.  \n",
    "- **Restarting kernel:** If the notebook becomes unresponsive, or if either the notebook or your code displays unexpected behavior, reset the notebook by choosing \"Kernel -> Restart & Clear Output\" from the menu bar. This will clear all memory objects in the notebook, stop any code running, and reset the notebook to its initial state. \n",
    "- **Session timeout:** Sessions will automatically shut down after about 10 minutes of inactivity. (If you leave a lab window open in the foreground, this will generally be counted as “activity”.) See Binder docs: [How long will my Binder session last?](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/about.html?highlight=session%20last#how-long-will-my-binder-session-last)\n",

While the first two tasks provide support on identifying and coding the stages of an aggregation pipeline, by the end of the of the section you'll be writing aggregation pipelines on your own. "
