    "- **Code cells:** Cells shaded grey are code cells. As you work through the lab, run all code cells in order.\n",
    "- **Running code:** To run code, press Shift + Enter or click the 'Run' button on the menu bar. Where there is code already in a cell, run it as written. Where a code cell contains the comment `#Write your code here`, write code to complete the task & then run it. If needed, consult the hints & answer to enter and run the correct entry for a task before moving on to the next task. Not every command will result in visible output.\n",
    "- **Markdown cells:** The non-code cells are written in the Markdown markup language. Double-clicking a Markdown cell will cause it to appear in raw Markdown format. To render as text again, run the cell just like running a code cell: press Shift + Enter or click the 'Run' button on the menu bar.  \n",
    "- **Restarting kernel:** If the notebook becomes unresponsive, or if either the notebook or your code displays unexpected behavior, reset the notebook by choosing \"Kernel -> Restart & Clear Output\" from the menu bar. This will clear all memory objects in the notebook, stop any code running, and reset the notebook to its initial state. \n",
    "- **Session timeout:** Sessions will automatically shut down after about 10 minutes of inactivity. (If you leave a lab window open in the foreground, this will generally be counted as “activity”.) See Binder docs: [How long will my Binder session last?](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/about.html?highlight=session%20last#how-long-will-my-binder-session-last)\n",
    "- **File navigation:** To navigate the other files in this lab, click on the folder icon (File Browser) at the top of the left sidebar and choose the `Contents.ipynb` file (or access the Contents file directly [here](../Contents.ipynb))\n",
